# What is this project?
This is a basic template that I created for myself that exposes a simple react app with `react-router-dom` and Auth0 authorization and Chakra UI for a styling library.

## Setting Up the project

- Sign up for a free Auth0 account if you have not.
- Create an "Application" resource on Auth0 and then, select the "Single Page Application" type.
- Then get the Domain and Client ID from the project you have just created and store them in `.env` with the same name as the variables in the `.env.example`
